## Project Development History

### Enhanced Plane and Terrain

**User Prompt:**
Make the plane a bit more realistic. It should look a bit like a WW2 Spitfire. Add "Minecraft" style trees on the ground and some rivers, all randomly generated.

**Claude:**
- Redesigned the plane to look more like a WW2 Spitfire:
  - Added elliptical wings with custom geometry
  - Created more detailed fuselage and tail
  - Added cockpit with transparent canopy
  - Added engine cowling and three-blade propeller
  - Added landing gear and RAF roundels
  - Used proper Spitfire blue color scheme
- Added procedurally generated terrain:
  - Implemented Minecraft-style cube trees (500 randomly placed)
  - Added randomly generated rivers using noise maps
  - Ensured trees don't spawn in rivers
- Updated bullet and rocket spawn positions to match new wing layout
- Updated README.md with new feature descriptions
